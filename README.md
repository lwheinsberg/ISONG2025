# Partnering with AI for Genomic Informatics: A Practical Annotated Workflow with Example Prompts

This repository supports the ISONG 2025 Expert Lecture:

*Heinsberg LW. Partnering with AI for Genomic Informatics: Practical Workflows for Data Analysis and Interpretation. International Society of Nurses in Genetics, Nov 2025, Montreal, Canada.*

## What is in this repo?

This repo contains a worked example of a **human-in-the-loop** AI analysis workflow.

The goal: **show how to responsibly partner with generative AI while maintaining scientific rigor.**

## Contents

**Main document (practical, annotated example):**  
→ [ISONG_2025.md](ISONG_2025.md)

This walks through:

- conceptual reasoning before coding  
- building **synthetic** data for safe development  
- pre-specification + team alignment  
- building code in small chunks  
- swapping in real data at the end  
- using AI as a coach (not a black box decision-maker)

### Final note

AI is powerful — but it is **not** a scientist.

This project exists to help us use AI wisely, safely, and in ways that make us **more rigorous, not less.**
